A Risk of Rain 2 loadout shuffler / randomizer. Picks a random survivor, abilities, and artifacts. Animations powered by anime.js.

Up to date website can be found here [RoR2 Loadout Randomizer](https://brycelehnen.github.io/RoR2-Loadout-Randomizer/)

I am only updating the site to have the new Survivors and artifact(s). I also added a random
end-game element which picks from the 5 different ways to end a run. There is also now a slider
to select the total number of artifacts.
